Using edX as an LTI Tool Provider
#####################################

.. note:: This feature was a closed pilot experiment. This feature is not
 supported for new users.

An experimental feature enabled the edX Edge site to be configured  to be a
learning tool interoperability (LTI) provider to other systems and  applications
that partner institutions use. After initial configuration and testing between
Edge and your system or application is complete, course teams could use this
feature to reuse Edge course content, including advanced problem types and
videos, in an on campus or in house learning management system. Examples
currently include courses running on Canvas and Blackboard.

You use the topics in this section to prepare a course for reuse in another
context.

You can also include content from an LTI provider in your edX courses. For
