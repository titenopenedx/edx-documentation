Academic Course Credit
#####################################

If your institution has an agreement with edX, you might be able to offer
academic credit for your course. Learners will be able to purchase this
academic credit after they meet requirements that you set. These requirements
typically include at least one proctored exam during the course as well as ID
verification at the beginning of the course. Learners can see a list of the
requirements on their **Progress** pages.

If your course offers academic credit, your edX partner manager completes the
initial setup of your course, including setting the price of credit and
enabling your course to offer credit. You can then complete the following
steps.

#. :ref:`Specify the minimum grade that a learner must earn to receive
   academic credit in the course <Specify Minimum Credit Eligible Grade>`.

#. :ref:`Add proctored exams to the course <CA_ProctoredExams>`. Proctored
   exams are timed exams that learners take while being monitored by online
   proctoring software. Only learners who have enrolled in the verified track
   see the proctored exam option in the course. Learners who are not in the
   verified track see the same exam in the course, but without the proctored
   exam option.

.. note::
  To make sure that learners' grades are correct, you must assign final grades
  for credit courses before you create certificates for the course. You assign
  final grades after the course end date. For more information, see
  :ref:`Checking Student Progress and Issuing Certificates`.

In addition to setting the usual grade scale for your course, you indicate a
specific grade that learners must receive to earn credit for your course.

#. In Studio, select **Settings**, and then select **Grading**.

#. In the **Credit Eligibility** section, specify a grade in the **Minimum
   Credit-Eligible Grade** box. This grade must be greater than or equal to
   the passing grade for the course.

For more information about grading, see :ref:`Grading Index`.
