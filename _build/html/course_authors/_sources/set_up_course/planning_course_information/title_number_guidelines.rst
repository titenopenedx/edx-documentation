Course Title, Number, and Enrollment Track
##########################################

The course title (sometimes also called the course name) and number are
important identifiers for your course. It is a good idea to use titles and
numbers that are easy to understand and remember.

The course enrollment track specifies the type of certificate, if any, that the
course offers. For more information about each enrollment track, see
:ref:`enrollment track<enrollment_track_g>`.

A course title, number, and enrollment track are required to create an About
page.

Enrollment Track Guidelines
***************************

The enrollment track specifies the certificate type, if any, that is
available for the course, as well as whether the course has a fee. All
enrollment tracks other than the audit enrollment track have a fee.

The edX platform offers the following enrollment tracks.

* audit
* credit
* professional
* verified

For more information about each enrollment track, see :ref:`enrollment
track<enrollment_track_g>` in the glossary.

.. note::
  For courses that offer a verified enrollment track, by default, the
  deadline for learners to upgrade to the verified track is 10 days before
  the course end date. The deadline for learners in the verified track to
  submit ID verification is the course end date. To request different
  deadlines, contact your edX project coordinator (PC).
