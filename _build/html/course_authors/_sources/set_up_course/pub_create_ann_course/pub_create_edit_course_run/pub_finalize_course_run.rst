.. note::
    Usually, when you submit a course run for PC review, the PC reviews the
    course run, the edX publisher role receives a notification, and then the
    edX publisher role publishes the About page.

    In some cases, the PC makes changes and returns the course run to the
    course team. In these cases, the course team reviews the edX PC feedback,
    and then finalizes the course run. This page describes how to finalize the
    course run.

To finalize a course run, you mark it as reviewed in Publisher.

#. :ref:`Sign in to Publisher<Signing In to Publisher>`.

#. Use one of the following methods to open the page for the course run.

   * On the dashboard, select the **In Development** tab, and then select the
     course run that you want. You can identify the course run by the start
     date.
   * On the **Courses** page, select the course that you want. When the page
     for the course opens, under **Course Runs**, select the course run.

#. On the course run page, finalize the course. To do this, under **Reviews**,
   select **Mark as Reviewed**.

   The status changes to **Reviewed**.

When you mark a course run as reviewed, the Publisher tool automatically sends
a notification to the edX publisher. The edX publisher then creates a preview
of the About page for the course run, and the course team accepts or declines
the About page preview. For more information, see :ref:`Pub Publishing an About
Page`.
