To create a course run in Publisher, follow these steps.

.. note::
  If one or more course runs have been published, Publisher pre-fills some
  information on the **New Course Run** page based on the last course run that
  has an About page on edx.org.

#. :ref:`Sign in to Publisher<Signing In to Publisher>`.

#. Use one of the following methods to open the **New Course Run** page.

   * On the dashboard, select **Add a Course Run**. Then, on the **New Course
     Run** page, select the course that you want in the **Find Course** list.
   * On the **Courses** page, select the course that you want. Then, on the
     page for the course, select **Add Run**.
   * When you create a new course, select **I want to add a run to this course
     at this time** at the bottom of the page, and then select **Create New
     Course**.

#. On the **New Course Run** page, enter the following information.

   * The course start and end dates. Times are in universal coordinated time
     (UTC).
   * Course pacing.

#. Select **Create New Course Run**.

The page for the course run opens. This page lists the course run information
that you have entered and the additional course run information that is
required for edX to create an About page.

At the top of the course run page, "breadcrumbs" are visible that list the name
of the course and the course run. For example, the breadcrumbs may be ``Courses
> Introduction to Music Theory > Self-paced: June 1, 2017``.

.. note::
  As soon as you select **Create New Course Run** in Publisher, Studio creates
  the same course run in Studio, and you can add course content in Studio. A
  link to the URL for the course run in Studio appears under **Studio URL** on
  the course run page.

  Additionally, when Publisher creates a Studio URL for the course run, Studio
  adds the user who created the course run as a course team member. That course
  team member must then add other course team members in Studio.
