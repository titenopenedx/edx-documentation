Send a Course Run to the edX PC for Review
##########################################

After you have finished editing the course run, you can send the course run for
review by the edX PC.

To send the course run for review, follow these steps.

#. :ref:`Sign in to Publisher<Signing In to Publisher>`.

#. Use one of the following methods to open the page for the course run.

   * On the dashboard, select the **In Development** tab, and then select the
     course run that you want. You can identify the course run by the start
     date.
   * On the **Courses** page, select the course that you want. When the page
     for the course opens, under **Course Runs**, select the course run.

#. On the page for the course run, select **Send for Review**.

When the PC reviews the course run, if the PC does not make any changes, the
edX publisher then creates an About page preview for the course. The course
team accepts or declines the preview. For more information, see :ref:`Pub
Publishing an About Page`.

In some cases, the PC makes changes and returns the course run to the course
team. In these cases, the course team then :ref:`finalizes the course run <Pub
Finalize a Course Run>`.
