.. note::
 Course certificates are associated with course runs. However, you configure
 course certificates in Studio. For more information, see :ref:`Setting Up
 Certificates`.

For more information about how to determine this information for your course
run, see :ref:`Planning Course Run Information`.

After you have determined and gathered this information for your course run,
you use the following process to create the course run in Publisher.

#. :ref:`Create the course run<Pub Create a Course Run>`. In this step, you
   provide only basic information about the course run, and Publisher creates a
   page for the course run.

   .. note::
     As soon as you create a course run in Publisher, Studio creates a URL for
     the course run in Studio. For more information, see :ref:`Pub Create a
     Course Run` or :ref:`Pub Access a Course Run in Studio`.

#. :ref:`Edit the course run <Pub Edit a Course Run>`, adding all required
   information for the About page.

#. :ref:`Send the course run to the edX PC for review <Pub Send a Course Run
   for Review>`.

   Usually, after the PC reviews the course run, the edX publisher receives a
   notification. The edX publisher role then creates an About page preview.

   In some cases, the PC makes changes and returns the course run to the course
   team. In these cases, the course team :ref:`reviews the edX PC feedback, and
   then finalizes the course run <Pub Finalize a Course Run>`.

#. :ref:`Accept or decline the About page preview <Pub Accept or Decline the
   Preview>`.
