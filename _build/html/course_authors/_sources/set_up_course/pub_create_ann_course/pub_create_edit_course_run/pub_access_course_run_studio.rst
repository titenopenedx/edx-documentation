#######################################

When you create a course and a course run in Publisher, Publisher immediately
creates a URL for that course run in Studio. You can then use that URL to
access the course run in Studio and add content to the course run.

.. note::
  When Publisher creates a Studio URL for the course run, Studio adds the user
  who created the course run as a course team member. That course team member
  must then add other course team members in Studio.

Additionally, Publisher sends an email notification to the course team. The
email notification contains a link to the course run in Studio and to the
course run page in Publisher.
