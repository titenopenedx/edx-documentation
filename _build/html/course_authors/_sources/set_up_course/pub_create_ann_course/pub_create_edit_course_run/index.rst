.. note::
  This process applies to courses on the edx.org site. If your course will run
  on Edge, you create the course and the About page in Studio. For more
  information, see :ref:`Creating a New Course` or :ref:`Creating a Course
  About Page`.

This section describes the process of creating a course run in Publisher.

.. note::
 As soon as you create a course run in Publisher, Studio creates the same
 course run in Studio. For more information, see :ref:`Pub Create a Course
 Run` or :ref:`Pub Access a Course Run in Studio`.
