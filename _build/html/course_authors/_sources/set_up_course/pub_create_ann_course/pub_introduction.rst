.. note::
  This information applies to courses on the edx.org site. If your course will
  run on Edge, you create the course and the About page in Studio. For more
  information, see :ref:`Creating a New Course` or :ref:`Creating a Course
  About Page`.

EdX Publisher is a tool that allows course teams, edX marketing, edX project
coordinators (PCs), and an edX publisher to work together to create an About
page. The Publisher tool tracks each action and sends email notifications when
actions are complete or required. You can view the status of your About page in
Publisher at any time.

This topic introduces new terms that Publisher uses, provides an overview of
the Publisher process, and explains how to complete common tasks.

  Information about a course run includes start and end dates, as well as staff

 :alt: A diagram showing the Publisher process, from the course team creating a
     course to the edX publisher publishing the About page.

#. :ref:`Create the course <Pub Creating a Course>`.

   #. The course team creates a course.
   #. The edX marketing team reviews the course for search engine optimization
      (SEO).
   #. The course team finalizes the course.

#. :ref:`Create the course run <Pub Creating a Course Run>`.

   #. The course team creates a course run for the course.
   #. The course team edits the course run, adding any additional required
      information.
   #. The edX PC reviews the course run.
   #. The course team finalizes the course run.

#. :ref:`Publish the About page <Pub Publishing an About Page>`.

   #. The edX publisher creates a preview of the About page for the course run.
   #. The course team reviews the About page preview.
   #. The edX publisher publishes the About page.

Some of these steps can occur concurrently. For example, a course team can
create and edit a course run before, while, or after edX marketing reviews a
course. However, the course team must finalize the course before the course
team can send the course run to the edX PC for review.
