.. note::

  You can edit your course at any time. However, keep the following guidelines
  in mind.

  * Changes to a course page affect not only the current course run, but all
    future course runs.
  * If you change a course after you have finalized the course, you must send
    the course to edX for review again.

At the top of the course page, "breadcrumbs" are visible that list the name of
the course. For example, the breadcrumbs may be ``Courses > Introduction to
Music Theory``.
