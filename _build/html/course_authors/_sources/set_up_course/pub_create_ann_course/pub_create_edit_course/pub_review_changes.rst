######################################

When the edX marketing team has finished reviewing the course, you can review
the changes and feedback from the edX marketing team, make final changes, and
mark the course as reviewed.

Changes that the edX marketing team has made are color coded. Additions are
highlighted in green, and deletions are highlighted in red. You can accept or
reject the changes. You can also make any additional changes that you want.

To review the changes, make final changes, and mark the course as reviewed,
follow these steps.

#. Use one of the following methods to open the course page.

   * Select the link in the email message.
   * :ref:`Sign in to Publisher<Signing In to Publisher>`, go to the
     **Courses** page, and select the course that you want from the list.

   When the page for the course opens, the changes that the edX marketing team
   has made are visible.

#. Review the changes from the edX marketing team, and accept the changes or
   make additional changes. Deletions are indicated in pink, and additions are
   indicated in green.

   * **If you are satisfied with all of the changes**, under **Revision
     History**,
     select **Accept All**.

   * **If you want to reject all changes** and return to an earlier version of
     the
     course, follow these steps.

     #. Under **Revision History**, select the version that you want. You see
        that version together with indicators of the changes that have been
        made.

        #. Select **Restore to this version**.

   * **If you want to accept only some of changes or make additional changes**,
     follow these steps.

     #. Under **Revision History**, select **Edit**.

        When you select **Edit**, the **Edit Course** page opens. The pink and
        green change indicators are no longer visible. Instead, if the text in
        a field has changed, that field now has three buttons: **View
        Changes**, **Accept All**, and **Reject All**.

     #. To view the changes, select **View Changes**. A field opens to the left
        of the text editing field, showing the pink and green change
        indicators.
