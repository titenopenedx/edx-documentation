To create a course in Publisher, follow these steps.

.. note::
 To find a course that has been created, see :ref:`Pub Find a Course`.

#. :ref:`Sign in to Publisher<Signing In to Publisher>`.
#. Use one of the following methods to create a new course.

   * On the dashboard, select **Add a New Course**.
   * On the **Courses** page, select **Courses**, and then select **Create New
     Course**.

#. On the **Create New Course** page, specify the following information.

   * The name of the course administrator for your organization.
   * The course title.
   * The course number.
   * The enrollment track (also called certificate type) that the course
     offers. For more information, see :ref:`enrollment
     track<enrollment_track_g>`.
   * The price for a certificate in the course. If the course does not offer
     certificates, leave the default value of 0 in the **Price** field.

#. Select the action that you want to take after you create a course.

   * If you want to create a new course run immediately after you create the
     course, select **I want to add a run to this course at this time**.

   * If you want to add more course information immediately after you create
     the course, leave this option blank.

#. Select **Create New Course**.

   If you did not select the **I want to add a run to this course at this
   time** option, the page for your course opens. This page lists the course
   information that you have entered and the additional course information that
   is required for edX to create an About page. You can edit course information
   at any time before you send the course to edX marketing for review. For more
   information, see :ref:`Pub Edit a Course in Publisher`.

   If you selected **I want to add a run to this course at this time**, the
   page for a course run of this course opens when you select **Create New
   Course**. On this page, you enter basic information about a course run. When
   you create the course run, Publisher immediately creates a Studio URL for
   the course, and you can enter content in Studio. For more information, see
   :ref:`Pub Creating a Course Run` or :ref:`Pub Access a Course Run in
   Studio`.
