Add a Course or Program About Video
##########################################

.. note::
  This process applies to courses on the edx.org site. If your course will run
  on Edge, you add the About video in Studio. For more information, see
  :ref:`Add an About Video`.

When you add an About video for a course or a program, you upload the video to
the edX About video upload page (https://prod-edx-video-encode-manager.edx.org/upload/). The PC then adds the About video to the
Publisher course page.

To add an About video for a course or program that is running on edx.org,
follow these steps.

#. In your browser, go to the edX About video upload page at
   https://prod-edx-video-encode-manager.edx.org/upload/.

#. Enter a title for the video that includes the course number and name or the
   program name. For example, the title might be ``edx101: Creating an edX
   Course`` or ``edx VideoX XSeries: Creating Video for the edX Platform``.

   You can abbreviate the full name of the course or program. However, the
   information that you enter should clearly identify your course or program.

.. note::
  If problems occur when you try to upload the About video by using the web app, try
  to upload the About video in a different browser, such as `Mozilla Firefox`_
  or `Safari`_.
