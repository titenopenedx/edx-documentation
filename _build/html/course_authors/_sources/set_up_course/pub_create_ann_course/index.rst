Creating and Announcing a Course Using Publisher (edx.org Courses)
###################################################################

.. note::
  This process applies to courses on the edx.org site. If your course will run
  on Edge, you create the course and the About page in Studio. For more
  information, see :ref:`Creating a New Course` or :ref:`Creating a Course
  About Page`.

Publisher is a companion to Studio. The topics in this section provide an
introduction to the Publisher tool and describe the Publisher process, from the
time when the course team creates a course to the time when the About page is
published on edx.org.

When you are ready to create a course and course run on edx.org, you add
information in the Publisher tool. The information that you enter depends on
your goal.

* **If your goal is to enter course content in Studio immediately**, you enter
  a small amount of specific course and course run information in Publisher.
  EdX will then create a Studio URL for a course run, and you can add content
  and modify settings in Studio. For more information, see :ref:`Pub Access a
  Course Run in Studio`.

* **If your goal is to create a course About page**, you enter all required
  information in Publisher. EdX then creates an About page for your course run
  and publishes the About page on edx.org.
